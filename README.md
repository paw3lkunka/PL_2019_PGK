# P≈Å Podstawy Gier Komputerowych 2019

Little rhythm-shoot'em'up game we made with Filip Mazurek, Magdalena Rogalska and Andrzej Miszczak in Unity Game Engine.

I mainly worked on User Interface and input system on multiple devices including keyboard, gamepad and joystick (yeah, runnin' in the 90s baby) :3

Original repo belongs to Andrzej Miszczak.
